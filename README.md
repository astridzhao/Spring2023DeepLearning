Project Title: Enhancing sentiment predictions with ChatGPT-based labeling

Team Members: Astrid Zhao, Avery Chen, Rahul Jain

Project Description: This project aims to train a deep learning model to perform accurate sentiment analysis on any given text. Sentiment analysis is the task of determining the emotion in a given text, classified into categories such as "negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive, and positive". We aim to leverage existing datasets: customer movie reviews with sentimental labelings from Stanford Sentiment Treebank to train our model.

Based on the knowledge, ChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) platform that utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate detailed insights from customer movie reviews. ChatGPT is based on a deep learning model called a Transformer. In this way, in our project, we decide to use Transformer to train our model.
