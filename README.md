Project Title: Enhancing sentiment predictions with ChatGPT-based labeling

Team Members: Astrid Zhao, Avery Chen, Rahul Jain

Project Description: This project aims to train a deep learning model to perform accurate sentiment analysis on any given text. Sentiment analysis is the task of determining the emotion in a given text, classified into categories such as "negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive, and positive". We aim to leverage existing data sets such as SST and Glue to train our model.
